            <h3>Gir National Park : The Majestic Home Of The Royal King :</h3>
            <p>Besides Africa, Gir National Park in Gujarat is the only place in the world where you can spot
                lions
                roaming free in the wild. The real discovery channel of India is situated approximately 65 Kms South
                East of
                Junagarh District. The Government notified the large geographical extent of Sasan Gir as wildlife
                sanctuary
                on
                18th September, 1965 in order to conserve the Asiatic Lion. It covers total area of 1412 square
                kilometers
                of
                which 258 Km forms the core area of the National Park. Indiscriminate hunting by the people of Junagarh
                led
                to
                their decrease in population drastically, while they were completely wiped out from the other parts of
                Asia.
                It
                was the kind effort of Nawabs of Junagarh who protected the queen royalty in his own private hunting
                grounds.
                Later in due course of time Department of Forest Officials came forward to protect the world’s most
                threatened
                species. From a population of approximately 20 lions in 1913, they have risen to a comfortable 523
                according
                to
                2015 census. There are 106 male, 201 female and 213 sub-adult lions in the wilderness of these four
                districts.</p>

        <h2>How To Reach Gir National Park Gir</h2><br><br>National Park attracts large number of tourists to witness

        16th October to 15th June every year. <br><br>

        Junagadh is perhaps the best approach to the park. The railway station in Junagadh receives trains from
        different cities like Ahmedabad and Rajkot and other major cities. Then, from here it takes approximately one
        and half hour to reach Sasan Gir National Park. <br><br>

        There are a number of privately operated that go to Junagadh at frequent intervals. Junagadh is nearly 105 Kms
        from the city Rajkot and it takes nearly 2 and a half to 3 hours to cover the distance.From this point you have
        two options. First one is either you take a bus from gate number 11or 12 to Sasan Gir or travel by taxi that is
        accessible bang opposite the taxi stand. The taxi will take nearly one and half an hour and will charge
        reasonably and will drop you to Sasan Gir. <br> <br>

        From Somnath to Gir National Park : Road Distance or the driving distance from the Gir National Park to Somnath
        is approximately 50 Kms and it takes nearly 1 hour to cover this distance. GSRTC buses and quite a few private
